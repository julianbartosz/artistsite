# Golden Hour Dreams

*From the Light Studies collection, 2024*

## About This Work

This piece explores the magical transformation that occurs during the golden hour, when ordinary landscapes become extraordinary through the alchemy of light. The warm, honey-colored illumination creates a dreamlike quality that hovers between reality and memory.

## Technique

Painted entirely *en plein air* over three separate sessions, I worked quickly to capture the fleeting effects of the changing light. The loose, impressionistic brushwork allows the colors to vibrate and blend optically, creating a sense of movement and atmosphere.

## Artist's Note

*"There's something about golden hour that makes the whole world feel like a secret. This painting attempts to hold onto that feeling - that moment when everything is perfect and fleeting."*
