# Convergence Study #3

*Part of the Convergence series, 2023*

## Concept

This drawing investigates the tension between presence and absence, exploring how negative space can be as powerful as mark-making. The geometric forms seem to emerge from and dissolve back into the paper's surface.

## Process

Working with traditional materials - vine charcoal and graphite pencils - I built up layers of tone while preserving critical areas of white paper. The result is a dialogue between the drawn and undrawn, the intentional and the accidental.

*This piece is matted and ready for framing.*
