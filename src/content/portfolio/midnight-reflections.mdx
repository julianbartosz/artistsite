# Midnight Reflections

*Part of the Urban Rhythms series, 2024*

## Artist Statement

**Midnight Reflections** captures the electric energy of the city after dark. The interplay between artificial light and shadow creates a visual symphony that speaks to the solitude and connection we experience in urban environments.

## Process & Technique

This piece began with an underpainting of deep Prussian blue and raw umber, establishing the nocturnal foundation. I then built up layers using:

- **Texture medium** applied with palette knife for architectural elements
- **Glazing techniques** with transparent oils for the luminous effects
- **Dry brush work** to create the sense of atmospheric perspective

## Inspiration

Walking through downtown late one evening, I was struck by how the city transforms after midnight. The harsh daylight geometry softens into something more mysterious and emotionally resonant. This painting attempts to capture that transformation.

## Technical Details

- **Support**: Gallery-wrapped canvas, ready to hang
- **Finish**: Satin varnish for protection and color stability
- **Signature**: Artist signed and dated on verso
- **Certificate**: Includes certificate of authenticity

*This piece is part of a limited series exploring urban environments through an abstract lens. Each work in the series examines different times of day and their unique emotional qualities.*
